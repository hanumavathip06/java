Java datatypes are used to specify the type of data a variable can store.
They are mainly divided into primitive and non-primitive types.
Java has eight primitive datatypes.
byte: 1 byte, stores integers from -128 to 127.
short: 2 bytes, stores integers from -32,768 to 32,767.
int: 4 bytes, most commonly used integer type.
long: 8 bytes, used for large integer values.
float: 4 bytes, used for decimal values with single precision.
double: 8 bytes, used for double-precision decimals.
char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.
boolean: stores either true or false.
Primitive types store actual values, not references.
Non-primitive types include String, arrays, classes, and interfaces.
Non-primitive types store reference to memory location.
String is the most commonly used non-primitive datatype.
Arrays store multiple values of the same datatype.
Class is a user-defined datatype used to create objects.
Interface defines abstract behaviors and is also non-primitive.
All datatypes help Java maintain strong type checking.
Choosing the right datatype improves memory efficiency and performanc
